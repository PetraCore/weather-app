# weather-app

Welcome to Weatherly, a fairly minimalistic weather-presenting web app.

## My rambling

This app is an another step in my programming journey through
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app#assignment).
This time I tried to focus more on the MVP that matches the assignment and some basic features that I deemed necessary. Although my inner perfectionism regrets that I didn't add more, I think it is for the best in the end. It's better to create something good enough and avoid burnout, than spend countless days chasing "perfection" and wasting most of the time in frustration and procrastination.

If you are a perfectionistic odin learner like myself, I encourage you to try doing the same. You can always come back to your projects later and add all the amazing features you have dreamt of. Don't get stuck in your learning journey doing pointless things. Focus first on getting the job done - then you are free to do your little experiments on a separate branch ;)

## My other rambling

Apparently, my c00l idea for the app name is pretty much not original, as it is an established English surname... Therefore, greetings to all the Weatherlies out there - hope you enjoy the fact that you made my brainstorming session not-so-fruitful in the end.

No, but seriously - have a great day! You have a pretty catchy surname - I'm jealous.

Oh and for you not-Weatherlies... I guess you can have a _less of a great day_, but _pretty much a great day overall nonetheless_.
